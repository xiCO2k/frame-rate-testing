# Frame Rate Testing

![Example Image](https://i.giphy.com/SUlhC4NT9hMyBz6SiH.gif)

This is an example I made to test the framerate from some old DSLR cameras,
basically having the camera recording the screen for some time to make sure
the frame rate is consistent.

Used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [AlpineJS](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine)
